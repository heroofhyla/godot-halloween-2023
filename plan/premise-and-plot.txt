## Premise

You're Chris Parker, an American. Your only child, Sam Parker, would be 16 years old now if he hadn't died three years ago in a tragic accident on a school trip to a factory.

The death was devastating. You and your wife Morgan Parker (nee Hill) split up shortly after the incident, and you haven't heard from her in a couple years.

One day, Morgan contacts you and asks to meet for coffee. At the cafe, she reveals that she's been having dreams. Dreams of the now-derelict factory that took her son's life. She is convinced that Sam is still there. His body was never found, after all. She's going after him, and wants you to come too.

You refuse. You tell Morgan that she needs to move on, that Sam isn't coming back. Finally, she agrees. She promises that she won't go to the factory.

A week later you get a call from Morgan's sister Holly. Morgan has gone missing.

With a growing sense of dread, you resolve to head to the factory yourself to learn the truth.
