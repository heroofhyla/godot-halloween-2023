# Untitled Halloween Game

This is a game I attempted to develop in about one month, hoping to be done before Halloween 2023. I didn't get very far, mostly due to a lack of motivation, but also due to spending too much time editing video for my devlog for the project.

The devlog starts here, if you're interested in watching it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AeshuhwX5Y]

One challenge with Godot is that, as a generalist game engine, it's not very streamlined for making any particular type of game. In this case, something like RPG Maker would have worked fine and I wouldn't have had to fight against the engine so much. You really have to write your own tools on top of Godot if you want to work efficiently.

I probably will not be continuing this game in the near future; maybe I'll come back to it in a few months if inspiration strikes. But hopefully someone finds it useful as learning material. The code and assets are available under an MIT license (see `00_game.txt` in the `license` directory).
